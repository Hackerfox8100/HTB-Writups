# Why Active Directory?
* designed to be backward-compatible, and many features are arguably not "secure by default," and it can be easily misconfigured
	* can be leveraged to move laterally and vertically within a network and gain unauthorized access
* A basic AD user account with no added privileges can enumerate most objects within AD
	* can be used to enumerate the domain and hunt for misconfigurations and flaws thoroughly
* multiple attacks can be performed with only a standard domain user account
