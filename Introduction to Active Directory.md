# Why Active Directory?
* designed to be backward-compatible, and many features are arguably not "secure by default," and it can be easily misconfigured
	* can be leveraged to move laterally and vertically within a network and gain unauthorized access
* A basic AD user account with no added privileges can enumerate most objects within AD
	* can be used to enumerate the domain and hunt for misconfigurations and flaws thoroughly
* multiple attacks can be performed with only a standard domain user account

* estimated that around 95% of Fortune 500 companies run Active Directory

# AD Attacks & Tools

* Shadow Credentials
	* allows for low privileged users to impersonate other user and computer accounts if conditions are right, and can be used to escalate privileges in a domain
* noPac
	* allows an attacker to gain full control over a domain from a standard domain user account if the right conditions exist
2020
