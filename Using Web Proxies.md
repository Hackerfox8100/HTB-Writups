# Intro to Web Proxies
* Web proxies are specialized tools that can be set up between a browser/mobile application and a back-end server to capture and view all the web requests being sent between both ends, essentially acting as man-in-the-middle (MITM) tools
* some of the other tasks we may use web proxies for besides capturing and replaying HTTP requests:
	*  Web application vulnerability scanning
	- Web fuzzing
	- Web crawling
	* Web application mapping
	- Web request analysis
	- Web configuration testing
	- Code reviews
